# Build Business Tools for SC Pressure Point

## Context
I'm a 16-year-old running a pressure washing business. I have a professional website (scpressurepoint.github.io) with working estimate/invoice generators, but I need better organization and a mobile app to manage customers.

## What Already Exists
- **Main site**: scpressurepoint.github.io (marketing, services, contact form)
- **Estimate tool**: `/pages/estimate` - detailed quote generator with dirt levels, multi-service support
- **Invoice tool**: `/business-tools/invoice.html` - creates invoices after jobs
- **Feedback form**: `/pages/form.html` - customer surveys
- **Broken tracker**: `/business-tools/customer-tracker.html` - needs LocalStorage fixed

## My Workflow
1. Customer contacts me → Schedule quote visit
2. On-site: measure, assess, give highball estimate
3. Do the job
4. Invoice them less than quoted (builds trust)
5. Send feedback survey

## Problems I Need Solved
- Customer info scattered everywhere (texts, notes, paper)
- I forget to follow up after quotes
- No centralized place for measurements/notes
- Can't access everything easily on my iPhone
- No job calendar/scheduling

## What I Need You to Build

### Main Tools Hub (`/business-tools/index.html`)
My "app" homepage with:
- Dashboard showing quick stats (leads, quotes, scheduled jobs, revenue)
- Big buttons to all my tools
- Follow-up reminders displayed prominently
- Today's jobs at a glance

### Fixed Customer Tracker (`/business-tools/customer-tracker.html`)
- Customer database with LocalStorage
- Pipeline: New Leads → Quoted → Scheduled → Completed
- Search and filter customers
- Auto follow-up reminders (default 3 days after quote)
- Link to estimate/invoice generators
- Export/backup data

### Simple Calendar (`/business-tools/calendar.html`)
- See scheduled jobs visually
- Color-coded by status
- Link to customer records

### Integration
- Estimate/invoice tools should link to customer tracker
- Pre-fill customer info between tools
- Save estimates/invoices to customer records

## Design Requirements
- **iPhone first** - must work great on mobile Safari
- Match the style/theme of my existing pages (scpressurepoint.github.io)
- Touch-friendly (big buttons, no tiny text)
- Fast and simple
- Works offline (LocalStorage)
- PWA capability (install to home screen)

## Important Notes
- Use vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no frameworks)
- Keep it simple - I'm 16, not a huge company
- Data stays local (LocalStorage for now, maybe cloud sync later)
- Make your own design decisions based on existing pages' look/feel
- Prioritize what actually helps me run my business better

## Priority
1. Fix customer tracker (most important)
2. Build tools hub
3. Link everything together
4. Add calendar
5. PWA setup

Build something practical that I'll actually use every day. Make it mobile-friendly and match my site's style.
