## User Personas & Primary Workflows

### 1. Field Worker (Day-of Operations)
**Primary needs:** Today's schedule, navigation, contact info, mark complete, photos
**Flow:** Home → Jobs (Today) → Job Detail → Navigate/Call → Complete → Photos

### 2. Owner/Scheduler (Office/Evening)  
**Primary needs:** Schedule jobs, manage leads, create quotes, track revenue
**Flow:** Varies - multiple entry points needed

### 3. Customer Service (Phone Intake)
**Primary needs:** Quick data entry, customer lookup, scheduling
**Flow:** Quick Add OR Customers → Schedule

---

## Workflow Analysis

### WORKFLOW 1: New Customer Inquiry (Phone Call)
**Current Flow:**
1. Go to Quick Add
2. Enter name, phone, address, service
3. Save as Lead or Schedule Job

**Issues:**
- ✗ Can't quickly check if customer already exists before creating duplicate
- ✗ No way to search customers FROM quick-add without opening modal

**Recommendations:**
- Add inline search-as-you-type on name/phone fields that shows matches
- "Customer exists" banner with "Use existing" button

---

### WORKFLOW 2: Returning Customer - New Job
**Current Flow:**
1. Go to Customers page
2. Find customer
3. ... no clear next step to schedule job

**Issues:**
- ✗ No "Schedule Job" button on customer detail
- ✗ Must go to Quick Add, then search for customer in modal

**Recommendations:**
- Add "Schedule Job" button to customer card/detail
- Add "Create Estimate" and "Create Invoice" buttons to customer detail
- Customer detail should show job history

---

### WORKFLOW 3: Following Up on Leads
**Current Flow:**
1. Go to Jobs page
2. Filter somehow? (no lead filter)
3. Find lead, contact them

**Issues:**
- ✗ No dedicated "Leads" view or filter
- ✗ No follow-up reminder system visible
- ✗ Leads mixed with jobs

**Recommendations:**
- Add "Leads" tab to Jobs page OR separate Leads section on Home
- Show follow-up dates prominently
- Add "Convert to Job" quick action
- Add "Mark Lost" action for dead leads

---

### WORKFLOW 4: Creating Estimate for Prospect
**Current Flow:**
1. Go to Home → Forms → Create Estimate
2. Manually type customer info
3. Generate estimate
4. Share via SMS/Email

**Issues:**
- ✗ No customer search/import on estimate page
- ✗ Estimate not saved to customer record
- ✗ No "Save as Lead" from estimate page
- ✗ No way to convert accepted estimate to scheduled job

**Recommendations:**
- Add "Select Customer" button to estimate page (search existing OR import VCF)
- Add "Save to Customer" option after generating
- Add "Convert to Job" button for accepted estimates
- Store estimates in customer history

---

### WORKFLOW 5: Post-Job Invoice Generation
**Current Flow:**
1. Complete job on Jobs page
2. Go to Home → Forms → Create Invoice
3. Manually re-enter customer info (or prefill from job)
4. Generate invoice

**Issues:**
- ✓ Prefill from job works (recently added)
- ✗ Invoice not stored/linked to job record
- ✗ No payment tracking after invoice generated

**Recommendations:**
- Store invoice data linked to job
- Add payment status tracking (Unpaid → Partial → Paid)
- Add "Send Reminder" action for unpaid invoices
- Show invoice history on customer detail

---

### WORKFLOW 6: Day-of Job Execution
**Current Flow:**
1. Home shows Today's Jobs (good!)
2. Click job → Full detail with Call/Navigate (good!)
3. Complete job, add photos (good!)

**Issues:**
- ✓ Mostly good flow
- ✗ No quick "Start Job" / "En Route" status
- ✗ No timer for job duration tracking
- ✗ Photos not easily accessible later

**Recommendations:**
- Add job status: New → En Route → In Progress → Complete
- Optional: Add timer that auto-fills duration
- Add photo gallery view (by customer or by job)

## Data Model Considerations

### Current Structure (Separate)
- `ppw-customers` - Customer records
- `ppw-jobs` - Job records (linked via customerId)

### Needed Additions
- Job.estimateId - Link to saved estimate
- Job.invoiceId - Link to saved invoice
- Job.invoiceStatus - unpaid/partial/paid
- Job.paymentReceived - Amount paid so far
- Customer.totalRevenue - Computed from completed jobs
- Customer.tags - VIP, Commercial, Residential, etc.

### New Storage Needed
- `ppw-estimates` - Saved estimate documents
- `ppw-invoices` - Saved invoice documents with payment tracking

---

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Flow Fixes
1. Add "Schedule Job" button to customer cards
2. Add "Leads" tab to Jobs page
3. Add customer search to Estimate page
4. Add customer search to Invoice page

### Phase 2: Data Connections
5. Customer Detail page (modal or full page)
6. Link invoices to jobs with payment tracking
7. Store estimates linked to customers/jobs

### Phase 3: Enhanced Features
8. Photo gallery view
9. Follow-up reminder notifications
10. Reports dashboard

## Notes on Design Philosophy

> "This app should be BETTER than 'Reach Out' in design and understanding but the same or better in functionality."

**Key Principles:**
1. **Reduce taps** - Common actions should be 1-2 taps away
2. **Context-aware** - Show relevant actions based on where you are
3. **Don't duplicate entry** - If data exists, don't ask for it again
4. **Clear status** - Always know where a job/lead stands
5. **Mobile-first** - Thumb-friendly, works in bright sun, one-handed operation

**Avoid:**
- Hidden features (everything should be discoverable)
- Dead ends (always have a next action)
- Manual data re-entry (search and prefill)
- Ambiguous states (clear labels for everything)
